Amidst the whispers of forgotten snow
A solitary heart beats, slow and low
The world outside recedes, a distant hum
As I am left to tend this inner thorn

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
